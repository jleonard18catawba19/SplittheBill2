# SplittheBill2

This app was created in my Object Oriented Design and Programming class. 
I used the KitKat Version, so it should be compatable with Android devices that allow Kitkat.
We used Strings which we used to created hints in the Text Box and helped us write the MainActivity Code. 
One will Enter The Total Bill Amount, the number of people in their party, adn the total Tip.
Then when you hit Calcualte it will give you a total per person
